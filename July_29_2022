We met with Danny Lee, Manager of Student Engagement for club authorization
We can create a club space, we can do it with our minimal number of 3 club officers
  -- talk to Lisa about creating flyers, cant be associated with school until club is ratified
Most important position so far is Treasurer

Most important thing to achieve before fall semester is 
1. passing club bylaws
  -- work with Danny on this one
  -- get old OOP clubs bylaws and reorient them
  -- get asb bylaws and make sure ours works with theirs
2. get a club name
3. filling out the form with our names and more definition

Possibilities for future stuffs
-- esports connects
-- aws cars and contact amazon
-- create a mod for the game Facade to utilize voice recognition technology
